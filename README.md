Project Name: Weather-what-where App

# Overview

Weather-what-where is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to check
real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. The app fetches data from a weather
API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions and a weather forecast.

# Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Weather API (SheCodes.io Weather API).

# Features

Search weather by city name.
Displays current time and day, real-time temperature, description, humidity and wind speed.
Responsive layout.
Clean and minimal user interface.

# How I Built It

Created the basic HTML structure and input form.
Designed the layout using CSS Flexbox.
Used JavaScript to handle search input, make API calls to fetch weather data, analyse and display
weather details on the page.
Styled weather details based on the data using emojis.

# Challenges I Faced

How to align the name of the city and temperature using CSS Flexbox and positioning.
How to fetch and display real-time data from the weather API.
